    <h2>🇰🇪 Our Mission</h2>
    <p>To unlock the full potential of every Kenyan learner through accessible, affordable, and high-quality education — delivered through innovative online platforms, offline resources, and culturally rooted learning.</p>

    <h2>🧠 Why Mr.Elimu Exists</h2>
    <p>Because every learner deserves dignity. Because sovereignty means learning without surveillance. Because emotional intelligence is not optional — it’s foundational.</p>

    <h2>🛠️ Built With Purpose</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Semantic HTML for clarity</li>
      <li>Accessible design for inclusion</li>
      <li>Offline resilience for sovereignty</li>
      <li>Emotionally intelligent UI for trust</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📜 A Note to the Learner</h2>
    <p>You are not just a user. You are the reason this exists. Every module, every button, every animation — was built to honor your journey. Welcome to Mr.Elimu. This is your classroom. This is your future.</p>
